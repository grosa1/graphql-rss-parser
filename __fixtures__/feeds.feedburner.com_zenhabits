Not fully awake to it&#8217;s immense beauty.</p>\n<p>How do we lose sight of the awesomeness of what&#8217;s right in front of us?</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s simple: <strong>we become acclimatized to our lives</strong>. Accustomed to our world. It becomes our &#8220;normal,&#8221; the background noise that we tune out.</p>\n<p>When we see things every day — sunlight, trees, beautiful faces — we start to think we know it already. It&#8217;s normal, even boring. Nothing to be noted.</p>\n<p>We walk by the deep blue flowers, the bright yellow leaves, the fresh green grass, the honeylike sunlight, and don&#8217;t even notice that it&#8217;s there.</p>\n<p>We take for granted things that are truly magic: flying in a plane, the miracle of electricity, the instantaneous communication of the Internet, the unlimited knowledge at our fingertips, the loved ones in our life, chocolate.</p>\n<p>We become accustomed, and then walk through life as in a dream.</p>\n<p>This process of becoming acclimatized is <em>normal</em>. We all do it. As toddlers, we find wonder and delight in everyday things — have you ever seen a child chase after a bubble or butterfly, or laugh in delight at a bouncing ball? Then we get used to it, and ignore it all in favor of our phones.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not criticizing any of us — we all do it, and it&#8217;s natural. But it&#8217;s good to know that we&#8217;re taking our world for granted. And then take actions to reverse it when we can.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Develop a practice of looking all around you with childlike eyes, seeing everything afresh, as if you&#8217;ve never seen it before. See the wonder in the everyday.</li>\n<li>Look around you, several times a day, and find small things that you&#8217;re grateful you have in your life. A cereal bowl to hold your oats and berries. A podcast. A window that gives you a beautiful view.</li>\n<li>Try to look at one person a day as if they were the most beautiful being on Earth. As if they were worthy of your love, of looking into their soul and understanding the depths of their being. As if they have a gift to offer the world, and your gift is to witness it. As if they have a tender heart that wants to be loved, as if they have pain worthy of your compassion.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Open your heart to the world around you, and behold its truly magnificent nature. We have been given a powerful gift, of being alive and witnessing this world. Let&#8217;s not forget it.</p>\n<h3>Zen Productivity: SF, LA, San Diego</h3>\n<p>Hey guys, I have a few spots left in my San Francisco workshop this weekend, as well as for L.A. and San Diego next month.</p>\n<p>I would love to have you come and work with me.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://zenhabits.net/zen-productivity-workshop/\">Zen Productivity Workshops</a></strong></p>\n<p>I just did my first one in NYC this past weekend, with a group of fantastic human beings.

And at the same time, it wants less — there&#8217;s a polarity in the mind that craves simplicity <em>and</em> craves more.</p>\n<p>Why does the mind want both? The mind wants more because it thinks that more will make it happy, it sees possibility in acquiring more, and it thinks that acquiring things will help relieve the uncertainty it feels.</p>\n<p>The mind wants less when it is feeling stressed and overwhelmed, and just wants relief from that difficult feeling. It thinks that if it gets rid of stuff, there will be peace.</p>\n<p><strong>Both are wrong</strong>, but they come from a good-hearted place.</p>\n<h3>Why the Desire for More, &amp; Less, are Both Wrong</h3>\n<p>The desire for more is wrong because, as we&#8217;ve all seen, you can get a bump of joy when you receive your new package in the mail &#8230; but it doesn&#8217;t even last a day, usually. Certainly not a few days. That dopamine hit of acquiring more is very temporary &#8230; and it doesn&#8217;t make us happier over the long term. It doesn&#8217;t actually give us what we&#8217;re hoping for in life, nor does it relieve any uncertainty.</p>\n<p>Think about it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are worried about an upcoming trip, you&#8217;ll research the destination, buy some new clothes or equipment to help you feel more prepared, make plans and have everything set in place. The uncertainty doesn&#8217;t go away, you&#8217;ve just kept yourself busy trying to get control as a way of coping with the stress of uncertainty.</li>\n<li>You got into a new hobby, excited by the awesome possibilities of it. Of course you had to buy more things to enable the hobby, but that&#8217;s OK, because it&#8217;s going to give you this amazing new life, right? Actually, your life might change, but it won&#8217;t ever be what you were fantasizing about. Your mind just tricks you.</li>\n<li>You got that beautiful new (outfit, bag, gadget, tool, whatever) and you think, &#8220;Oh, isn&#8217;t life grand?&#8221; But then your life returns to normal, and it&#8217;s not any better, except now you&#8217;re a little poorer and you have a cool new thing in it to clutter up your space.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So when the mind wants more, it is simply trying to find happiness or relief from stress. Neither actually results from having more, but that doesn&#8217;t stop the mind from trying.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the mind&#8217;s desire for <em>less</em> is just a desire for peace. And that&#8217;s not a bad thing. You get some peace, I think, when you reduce your possessions or commitments. Creating space is nice. But in the end, your mind still will find something to complain about — if it&#8217;s not having too many things, or too much to do, it will be boredom or tiredness or irritating people who have too much clutter in their lives.</p>\n<p>The key is to change the mental habits.</p>\n<h3>Changing the Mental Habits</h3>\n<p>Changing mental habits is pretty tough (though we do show you how in my <a href=\"https://zenhabits.net/habit-mastery/\">Habit Mastery Course</a>, check it out!). You have to be hyper aware of your thoughts in order to change them.</p>\n<p>Still, none of us ever let a tough challenge stop us from taking action, right?</p>\n<p>The process is simple:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>develop awareness of your mental habits over time</li>\n<li>see what their harmful effects might be</li>\n<li>stop believing the thoughts</li>\n<li>make a loving effort to change them</li>\n<li>and don&#8217;t expect perfection</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So with the mental habit of wanting more, you might just notice when you&#8217;re online and researching something new to buy, or on Amazon or another shopping site ready to hit the &#8220;order&#8221; button. This is a good signal that your mind is wanting more in order to become happier and/or relieve uncertainty.</p>\n<p>When you notice this, ask yourself (with credit to <a href=\"http://thework.com/en\">Byron Katie</a>):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What do I believe I&#8217;ll get if I buy this? More happiness? Less uncertainty?</li>\n<li>Is that belief true?</li>\n<li>What effect does it have on me? Is it helpful to believe this, or harmful?</li>\n<li>What would I be like if I didn&#8217;t believe it?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So if I&#8217;m trying to buy some new travel gear, I might notice that I believe it will give me less uncertainty to get this gear. When I ask if it&#8217;s true, I will answer, &#8220;No, I know from experience that it isn&#8217;t true. I&#8217;ll still feel uncertainty.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll also notice that this belief is harmful, because it&#8217;s filling my life with more stuff and emptying my bank account, and it&#8217;s certainly not helpful.</p>\n<p>What would I be like if I didn&#8217;t believe it? I would be less intent on acquiring, more able to open up to my uncertainty and find peace by not needing to relieve it.</p>\n<p>So I try to change it by saying to myself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You don&#8217;t need this new gear</li>\n<li>You know it won&#8217;t relieve your uncertainty</li>\n<li>Opening to your uncertainty with a loving heart is the way to go</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then I try to fully feel the uncertainty, loving it as much as I love chocolate or laughter, and feel the awesome beauty of life in the midst of the uncertainty.</p>\n<p>This is how we can change our mental habits. With awareness, with honesty, with an open heart, and with appreciation for the immense joy of life in the midst of chaos.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\r\n\t\t\t</item>\r\n\t\t<item>\r\n\t\t<title>In Love with the Heartbreaking Beauty of the Discomfort</title>\r\n\t\t<link>https://zenhabits.net/heartbreak/</link>\r\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2017 19:27:23 +0000</pubDate>\r\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[zenhabits]]></dc:creator>\r\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Happiness]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Mindfulness]]></category>\r\n\r\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://zenhabits.net/?p=19091</guid>\r\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[By Leo Babauta With my body in pain, I looked up at the sunlight and kept my heart open.

It wasn&#8217;t beautiful in spite of the pain — the pain was a part of its total beauty. The struggle and discomfort itself was heart-renderingly gorgeous, as was everything else in the moment.</p>\n<p>This weekend I took part in a workshop on relationships and intimacy called <strong>the Art of Fearless Intimacy</strong>, by <a href=\"https://www.johnwineland.com/\">John Wineland</a> and <a href=\"http://www.kendracunov.com/\">Kendra Cunov</a>. There&#8217;s a lot I could write about the weekend, which was life-changing, but I want to speak to just one moment.</p>\n<p>The moment:</p>\n<p>I was in a standing pose, doing about a quarter squat, with my arms raised in the air. For what seemed like an eternity.</p>\n<p>I was looking deeply into another man&#8217;s eyes, a complete stranger, and also a brother and fellow warrior. We held each other&#8217;s eyes, and matched each other&#8217;s breath, for more than half an hour.</p>\n<p>We came to be in deep discomfort, holding ourselves in stillness in that pose. My shoulders ached, screamed for mercy, wanted nothing more or less than rest from the work. My mind wanted to get away from the discomfort.</p>\n<p>And in this moment, I could see my mental habit: reject discomfort and pain, shut it down, get away from it, find peace from it. This is a pattern that has held me in sway since boyhood.</p>\n<p>In this moment, I found a place where I was devoted to this brother, and wouldn&#8217;t let him down. I wanted to show him, through my gaze, my deepest soul, my devotion to those I loved, my fierce heart ready to go to battle for him, for my family, for all of you.</p>\n<p>In this moment, I soaked in the beauty of the light around us, the sound of other men roaring, the beauty of this fellow soul right in front of me, showing me his courage.</p>\n<p>In this moment, I fell in love with all of it.</p>\n<p>With life, in its total grandeur.</p>\n<p>With pain and discomfort, as part of the divinity and magic of that moment.</p>\n<p>With my own heart, which I often shut down in fear. No longer would I allow myself to shut down. I kept it open, and saw the absolute pristineness of my glorious heart.</p>\n<p>I fell in love with life, and had my heart broken. And I loved the pain of that heartbreak, completely.</p>\n<p>Thank you to my brother who held me in that space. Thank you to John and Kendra, who led me there.</p>\n<p>And thank you to my wife, my kids, my other loved ones, and all of you, who give me a powerful reason to keep my heart open to the heartbreaking awe-inspiring discomfort of being alive.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\r\n\t\t\t</item>\r\n\t\t<item>\r\n\t\t<title>Simplifying Your Digital Life</title>\r\n\t\t<link>https://zenhabits.net/simplify-digital/</link>\r\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 02 Nov 2017 16:28:09 +0000</pubDate>\r\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[zenhabits]]></dc:creator>\r\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Mindfulness]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Simplicity]]></category>\r\n\r\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://zenhabits.net/?p=19086</guid>\r\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[By Leo Babauta It&#8217;s a simple fact of our modern lives that we live, play, learn and connect online.

Simplify to find peace. Simplify to find a way through the sea of chaos.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at some things you can do today to create the elegance of simplicity and focus in your life.</p>\n<h3>Simplify to Clear Distractions</h3>\n<p>The distraction of multitasking and technology can be hard to overcome. But it drains away our mindfulness, effectiveness, and life energy. So let&#8217;s do something about it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zenhabits.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_0295.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-19062\" src=\"https://zenhabits.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_0295-169x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"169\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://zenhabits.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_0295-169x300.png 169w, https://zenhabits.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_0295-576x1024.png 576w, https://zenhabits.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_0295.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start with the phone. I recently decided to go minimalist with my iPhone (&#8220;Throw it away!&#8221;, you might suggest!) &#8230; and I simplified:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Put all apps into one folder. I call mine &#8220;uncertainty&#8221; to remind me that everything lives in uncertainty.</li>\n<li>Keep the dock &amp; homescreen clear. No tempting apps to click on. Instead, I use the search function to open an app, requiring myself to type in the name, which makes me think about what I&#8217;m doing.</li>\n<li>Shut off almost all notifications.</li>\n<li>Choose a simple and beautiful background to remind me to be mindful when using the phone.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>See my <a href=\"https://zenhabits.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_0295.png\">empty home screen</a>, <a href=\"https://zenhabits.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_0296.png\">2nd screen with just my meditation app</a>, and <a href=\"https://zenhabits.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_0298.png\">3rd screen with my single folder</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zenhabits.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-25-at-1.15.08-PM-1024x576.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-19066\" src=\"https://zenhabits.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-25-at-1.15.08-PM-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" srcset=\"https://zenhabits.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-25-at-1.15.08-PM-1024x576.png 1024w, https://zenhabits.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-25-at-1.15.08-PM-300x169.png 300w, https://zenhabits.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-25-at-1.15.08-PM-768x432.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s move on to the computer, which has some similar steps (these instructions are for a Mac but Windows/Linux users could use similar ideas):</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Clear your desktop</strong> (put all files into one folder, or several). Put a <a href=\"https://zenhabits.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/groundlessness.jpg\">nice wallpaper</a> in the background.</li>\n<li><strong>Clear the dock</strong>. Instead, use a search app to open apps, such as <a href=\"https://thesweetsetup.com/apps/our-favorite-os-x-launcher/\">Alfred, Spotlight or Launchbar</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Turn off most notifications</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Single-task</strong>. Close all apps but the one(s) you&#8217;re using.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://zenhabits.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-25-at-1.20.08-PM.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-19076\" src=\"https://zenhabits.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-25-at-1.20.08-PM-1024x564.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" srcset=\"https://zenhabits.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-25-at-1.20.08-PM-1024x564.png 1024w, https://zenhabits.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-25-at-1.20.08-PM-300x165.png 300w, https://zenhabits.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-25-at-1.20.08-PM-768x423.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></p>\n<p>And now let&#8217;s talk about the browser &#8230; I use Chrome, but you could find similar things for whatever you use:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Single tab</strong>. Close everything else. If it&#8217;s important, throw it into a read-later service, bookmark it, or put it into your todo manager.</li>\n<li><strong>Close your email program</strong>. When you open it, open with intention, and clear out the inbox as much as you can. Then close it.</li>\n<li><strong>Use the <a href=\"https://momentumdash.com/\">Momentum add-on</a></strong> to keep yourself focused and mindful.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I like single-tasking apps, at full screen, like <a href=\"https://ommwriter.com/\">Ommwriter</a>, when I&#8217;m writing or doing other work outside of the browser.</p>\n<p>Outside of the phone and computer, I like to keep a notebook of my tasks for the day (<a href=\"http://bulletjournal.com/\">bullet journal style</a>). And I keep my desk as clear as possible.</p>\n<p>Simplifying your physical and digital workspaces will help you be less distracted, and more able to focus on a single task.</p>\n<h3>Simplify Your Intention &amp; Focus</h3>\n<p>As much as possible, it&#8217;s best to focus on a single task at a time. With intention.</p>\n<p>That means, instead of constantly switching around (the default mode for many of us), it&#8217;s best to pick one thing and set aside some time (10 minutes, half an hour, etc.) to focus on just that thing. If it&#8217;s important enough to take up your attention and time, it&#8217;s important enough to give it the space for complete focus.</p>\n<p>When you clear everything aside, before you dive fullbore into the task, ask yourself, &#8220;What is my intention here?&#8221; If it&#8217;s to help your team, help your client, help your family, help yourself have a better life &#8230; it will help you connect your task to something meaningful.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the intention is just to learn to focus better. Maybe it&#8217;s to push into discomfort and uncertainty. Maybe it&#8217;s to be mindful and joyful as you work. Whatever your intention, set it consciously.</p>\n<p>Then get started, with focus. Don&#8217;t let yourself do anything else, even if you feel the urge to switch. At least for 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>Simplify by setting intention and keeping your focus on one thing at a time, as much as you&#8217;re able. This is a practice, which means you won&#8217;t be perfect at it, but <a href=\"https://zenhabits.net/progress/\">daily practice helps you get better</a>.</p>\n<h3>The Elegance of Simplicity</h3>\n<p>As you narrow your focus on fewer things, simplify your workspace so that there are fewer distractions, and practice <a href=\"https://zenhabits.net/single-minded/\">single-minded focus</a> with intention &#8230; things start to change.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s like the reverse of how the distraction of technology and social media changes our brains. Our brains seem to become calmer, more at peace, when we find joy in the elegance of simplicity.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the elegance of nothing but you, your meditation cushion, and your breath. There is nothing to distract you from the single-minded practice of being here in this moment, practicing with groundlessness.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the elegance of nothing but you and your yoga mat, as you sink into child&#8217;s pose and then start a sun salutation, nothing to distract you from the single-minded practice of being with your breath and movement.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the elegance of nothing but you and your notebook, as you journal or sketch. The elegance of you and nature, as you head out for a morning run. The elegance of you and the barbell, the kettlebell, or the hill that you&#8217;re tackling.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the pure elegance of simplicity, and it is found in the paring down.</p>\n<h3>The Zen Productivity Workshop</h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m excited to announce the first in a series of workshops I hope to hold in the next year or two &#8230; the Zen Productivity Workshop.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s coming first to NYC and San Francisco (in November) and then L.A. and San Diego (in December).

We have seen ourselves give up on habits many times, because:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We are busy.</li>\n<li>We procrastinate because we&#8217;re tired or just don&#8217;t feel like it.</li>\n<li>We get distracted by our addictions.</li>\n<li>We are afraid of failure.</li>\n<li>We don&#8217;t like the discomfort of the task.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We are our own biggest obstacle to the new habits we want to create in our lives.</p>\n<p>The biggest reason is because we come up with <em>all kinds of objections</em>.</p>\n<p>And then we listen to those objections.</p>\n<p>We object to waking up early to write, because we&#8217;re tired. Tiredness is a big objection of ours.</p>\n<p>We object to doing yoga or exercising, because it&#8217;s hard and we don&#8217;t feel like it right now. We&#8217;d rather check our phones. Procrastination because distraction is easier than discomfort is another major way we deal with our objections.</p>\n<p>We object to the difficult studying, because it makes us feel like losers to not know what we&#8217;re doing. This feeling of uncertainty is another huge objection.</p>\n<p>We object to the daily practice, because it feels restricting. It feels useless somehow, to practice but not get anywhere. It&#8217;s not working.</p>\n<p>We object to discomfort, uncertainty, being overwhelmed, having to do something regularly, not being able to comfort and reward ourselves whenever we want.</p>\n<p>How do we overcome these objections? How do we overcome the obstacles of ourselves? Let&#8217;s investigate a few ideas.</p>\n<h3>Overcoming Our Own Objections</h3>\n<p>There might not be just one answer to this obstacle. I interviewed <a href=\"https://gretchenrubin.com/\">Gretchen Rubin</a> yesterday for <a href=\"https://habitmasterycourse.com/\">my new Habit Mastery Course</a> (she&#8217;s got <a href=\"https://gretchenrubin.com/books/the-four-tendencies/intro/\">an amazing new book out, the Four Tendencies</a>, on this very topic) &#8230; and her theory is that people respond differently depending on how they respond to expectations &#8212; their own expectations, and other people&#8217;s.</p>\n<p>So the right answer for me might not be the right answer for you.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at a few different approaches — I suggest you try one out, and see if it works. Experiment!</p>\n<h3>Have Answers to the Objections</h3>\n<p>If we have a set of common objections to sticking to something, then we can pre-plan our answers instead of blindly believing the rationale we usually use.</p>\n<p>Here are some common objections, with examples of how you might plan to answer them:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>I&#8217;m tired (or don&#8217;t feel like it)</strong>. Answer: Just do a little bit of it. You don&#8217;t have to do it for very long &#8230; if you can do one minute (or write one paragraph), you can call that a win for today.</li>\n<li><strong>Why should I put myself through this</strong>. Answer: This is a gift to yourself. Doing this habit is a loving way to make your life better, and always putting it off is a harmful habit. See the deliciousness in this experience!</li>\n<li><strong>You deserve a break/treat</strong>. Answer: Take a break right <em>after</em> you do it for a minute. Or &#8230; let this be your treat!</li>\n<li><strong>I&#8217;ll do it in a minute (or &#8220;One won&#8217;t hurt)</strong>. Answer: You know that rationale is a lie. Don&#8217;t listen to the lies you tell yourself when you&#8217;re tired or afraid. Instead, tell yourself that doing the habit for one minute won&#8217;t hurt. Or putting off doing something you&#8217;re trying to quit (cigarettes, for example) won&#8217;t hurt.</li>\n<li><strong>This is scary/sucks because I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing</strong>. Answer: Yep, the uncertainty is scary! And yet, everything good in your life has come because you pushed into uncertainty. So see it as something to savor, this uncertainty, because it is the ground where you learn, grow, and get better. Learn to relish in it.</li>\n<li><strong>This is hard, I&#8217;ll do it later</strong>. Answer: Do a small dose of the hard stuff now, then go to your favorite distraction after. Switch up the order and things get a lot better in your life.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Of course, the answers above won&#8217;t necessarily be the best ones for you &#8230; so figure out what answers work for you.</p>\n<h3>Set Up Your Environment</h3>\n<p>If having answers to your objections doesn&#8217;t work, you might set up your environment to be more conducive to habit success, when you&#8217;re feeling good and optimistic.</p>\n<p>Some ideas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clear away distractions. Make it hard to get to them.</li>\n<li>Make your best option the most convenient option. Put out the healthy snacks where you can see them, and make yourself have to drive to the store to get the unhealthy stuff.</li>\n<li>Tell others in your house/office that you&#8217;re not going to do something (not go on Facebook, not eat candy) &#8230; and if they catch you doing it, you owe them $50.</li>\n<li>Get others to join you in a challenge.</li>\n<li>Put reminders or inspiration everywhere.</li>\n<li>Make your Instagram or Twitter feed only filled with inspiration, not distractions.</li>\n<li>Ask others to encourage you on your goal every time they see you.</li>\n<li>Set up your yoga mat, meditation cushion, writing space, or sewing area so that it&#8217;s easy to dive into your new habit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Again, what works for one person won&#8217;t work for others, so experiment!</p>\n<h3>Find the Freedom</h3>\n<p>Some people really don&#8217;t work well with restrictions or being told they have to do something over and over. If that&#8217;s you, then find the freedom in the activity.</p>\n<p>Why eat broccoli and kale? If you make it something your mom is telling you to do, you might hate it. But if you find the deliciousness in fresh, healthy, whole food, maybe it can seem like a wonderful choice. If you think about the freedom it gives you to be healthy, strong, fit and able to do all kinds of outdoor activities, then kale becomes a beautiful empowering leaf.</p>\n<p>Why give up cigarettes? Instead of thinking of this as a restrictive thing, think of it as freedom from the burden of having to buy cigarettes, financial freedom, freedom from being tied to a burdensome habit for the rest of your life, freedom from getting super sick from smoking (which will absolutely suck for you and your loved ones).</p>\n<p>Why sit down every day to write your book? Think of it as freedom from procrastination and distraction, freedom to express yourself, freedom to finally create when you&#8217;ve been running from it for so long.</p>\n<p>Find the deliciousness, the treat, the freedom, the fun. And soon you&#8217;ll be not your own biggest obstacle, but your own biggest supporter.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>My Habit Mastery Course</h3>\n<p>I&#8217;d love for you to join my new video course, <a href=\"https://habitmasterycourse.com/\">Habit Mastery</a>, which <strong>starts this week</strong>, and is designed to help you practice and level up your habit skills.</p>\n<p>It’s a 12-week course with two video lessons a week, daily practice, and interviews with 11 other amazing habit experts.</p>\n<p>This is one of the best things I’ve ever created, and I really hope you’ll <a href=\"https://habitmasterycourse.com/\">join me</a>.</p>\n<p>The course includes weekly Q&amp;A where I answer your habit obstacle questions, a Facebook group for support from fellow participants, and 7 bonus ebooks. All of this for $299. The course starts this week (but you can start anytime) … and it will run for 12 weeks.</p>\n<p>What will we cover in this course? Basically, the goal is to get you from one level of mastery to the next:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Beginner to Intermediate</strong>: You struggle to create habits, and feel a bit lost in sticking to anything over the long term. We’ll have you practice the basics and some key skills to overcome the most common beginner problems.</li>\n<li><strong>Intermediate to Advanced</strong>: You have successfully created some habits, but often have them fall apart when things get disrupted, and struggle with more difficult habits. We’ll have you practice advanced skills, and your habits will get more solid overall.</li>\n<li><strong>Advanced to Habit Master</strong>: You are pretty good at creating habits, but are in a place where you’re trying to optimize your day, and are dealing with the more dynamic aspects of habit creation. Also, you’d like to tackle some of the hardest habits — mental habits. You’ll practice these and be amazing at everything.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Of course, it will all depend on how much work you put into it, but with the video lessons, daily practice, Facebook support group and ability to ask questions … we believe you’ll be in the optimal conditions for getting good at habits.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://habitmasterycourse.com/\">Read more here, and please consider joining me</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\r\n\t\t\t</item>\r\n\t\t<item>\r\n\t\t<title>The Incredible Progress of Daily Practice</title>\r\n\t\t<link>https://zenhabits.net/progress/</link>\r\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 20 Oct 2017 19:51:01 +0000</pubDate>\r\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[zenhabits]]></dc:creator>\r\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Goals & Motivation]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Habits]]></category>\r\n\r\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://zenhabits.net/?p=19044</guid>\r\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[By Leo Babauta Lately in my life, I&#8217;ve been repeatedly reminded of the power of practicing something regularly.

But recently I committed to practicing yoga for just 10 minutes a day (a few sun salutations, mostly) &#8230; when I started, my shoulders would get exhausted in downward dog fairly quickly. But now, I&#8217;m able to hold the poses for longer without tiring as much! I&#8217;ve really seen some solid progress with just 10 minutes of daily practice. Of course, that&#8217;s not the point of yoga (it&#8217;s a mindfulness practice), but it&#8217;s still amazing to see that kind of progress.</li>\n<li><strong>Running 3-4 times a week with Eva</strong>: Eva and I started doing a half-marathon training plan by <a href=\"http://www.nomeatathlete.com/\">No Meat Athlete</a> about 6 or 7 weeks ago. We do 3-4 runs a week (depending on our schedules), and when we started out, we were both pretty out of shape. Eva had to stop a couple times even on a 2-mile run, and I was far from my peak running shape. But six weeks into it &#8212; just doing short runs &#8212; we can see a huge difference. At no point did we push ourselves too hard, but just doing it regularly really made a solid amount of progress.</li>\n<li><strong>Studying go for just 10-20 minutes a day</strong>: I&#8217;ve been studying the ancient Chinese game of go this year, and I&#8217;m still very weak at it. Honestly, if I had more time to study, I might be much stronger. But instead, I&#8217;ve been just doing about 10-20 minutes of studying a day, and I&#8217;m still making noticeable progress with my calculating ability. Still not strong, but I&#8217;m getting stronger slowly, just putting in a minimal amount of study time.</li>\n<li><strong>Chinups with my son 3 times a week</strong>: In the last couple of weeks, my 13-year-old son and I decided to do a chinups challenge. Three times a week, we do five sets of chinups during the day. When I started out, I could only do 10-11 chinups per set, but now I can do 16-17 each set. In less than two weeks. That kind of progress is encouraging.</li>\n<li><strong>Daily focus sessions by a client</strong>: I have a coaching client who does daily focus sessions, training himself to focus on something longer. He just does 15-minute sessions every day, which isn&#8217;t a lot. But he&#8217;s seen his ability increase noticeably, even when he&#8217;s not doing a focus session.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Just a small amount of daily practice, or at least a few times a week. It&#8217;s powerful.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve learned:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>If you&#8217;re studying something, you forget less</strong>. It&#8217;s great to study for a couple hours, but if you don&#8217;t study for a few days after that, you&#8217;ll start forgetting. Daily study sessions, even if they&#8217;re short, interrupt the forgetting process. Therefore it&#8217;s more efficient, as you don&#8217;t slip backwards but keep making forward progress.</li>\n<li><strong>If you are weak, you get stronger without injury</strong>. It&#8217;s hard to get stronger when you&#8217;re weak (at yoga, running, chinups, whatever). But small regular doses will get you stronger, slowly. If you give yourself big doses, hoping for faster progress, you&#8217;re more likely to get injured, burn out, or get demotivated because of the difficulty level. Slow and small is better.</li>\n<li><strong>Progress isn&#8217;t noticeable in the first week, but it is after a couple of weeks</strong>. If you&#8217;re just giving yourself small training or study doses, you won&#8217;t see any difference at first. That&#8217;s OK, keep doing it. After a couple of weeks, you&#8217;ll notice some solid progress, and a month into it, you&#8217;ll see major improvement. Keep at it.</li>\n<li><strong>Small doses make it easy to do daily</strong>. If you want to train for an hour a day, that is only sustainable for awhile. Eventually you&#8217;ll run out of energy, or things will get busy and you won&#8217;t have the time for your hourlong session. Maybe you&#8217;ll miss 2-3 days in a row &#8212; now you&#8217;ve lost motivation, and you&#8217;re discouraged. It&#8217;s better to do it in small doses, because it&#8217;s easier to get started when you know you&#8217;re just doing 10-15 minutes, and it&#8217;s easier to find the time and motivation for small sessions.</li>\n<li><strong>Make sure it&#8217;s fun</strong>. Doing a chore is boring and hard, and you&#8217;ll put it off, even if it&#8217;s just a 10-minute session. Instead, don&#8217;t make it a chore that you have to get through. Make it a game that you look forward to doing. Or a mini-meditation session that brings peace to your life, a time to relax. Or a moment of magic and loveliness. Create an activity that you&#8217;ll look forward to.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Bring the magic of small, regular practice to your life.</p>\n<h3>My Habit Mastery Course</h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to get better at habits and daily practice, please join my new video course, <a href=\"https://habitmasterycourse.com/\">Habit Mastery</a>, which is designed to help you practice and level up your habit skills.</p>\n<p>It’s a 12-week course with two video lessons a week, daily practice, and interviews with 11 other amazing habit experts.</p>\n<p>This is one of the best things I’ve ever created, and I really hope you’ll <a href=\"https://habitmasterycourse.com/\">join me</a>.</p>\n<p>The course includes weekly Q&amp;A where I answer your habit obstacle questions, a Facebook group for support from fellow participants, and 7 bonus ebooks.

This simple focus can make you incredibly effective, and you&#8217;ll accomplish more.</li>\n<li><strong>Simplicity</strong>: Our lives get filled with clutter and complexity when we constantly want to add things. By letting go of what we want to have, and some of what we already, we can simplify, declutter, create space, let go of complexity.</li>\n<li><strong>Finances</strong>: Our finances would be much better if we didn&#8217;t spend so much. Of course, you could argue that we could just earn more, which is true. But spending less and earning more is actually better than all of that! Anyway. Letting go of things we want to spend on is the key to better finances. More on that below.</li>\n<li><strong>Happiness</strong>: When we are frustrated with someone, disappointed with ourselves, unhappy with our situation, angry at something in the past &#8230; what is standing in the way of our happiness? We could blame the other person, or ourselves, or our situation, or the thing in the past &#8230; but actually, the thing preventing our happiness is being stuck on an ideal or expectation. We could let go of how we want others to be, how we want our lives to be, how we want ourselves to be &#8230; and find contentment in the way things are. This is hard for people to accept — because they aren&#8217;t good at letting go yet. Again, more below.</li>\n<li><strong>Weight loss</strong>: Eat less, by slowly reducing portion sizes and eating more vegetables and beans (low in calories, high in bulk). This is a simple recipe for weight loss (I would add strength training and other exercise, but let&#8217;s keep things simple), but what stands in our way of eating less? Wanting to eat pleasurable foods, junk foods, comfort foods, bigger portions. If we let go of these wants, we could eat less. Yes, it&#8217;s possible (I&#8217;ve done it many times).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>More on all of this in the sections below. But first, let&#8217;s look at what letting go actually means.</p>\n<h3>The Process of Letting Go</h3>\n<p>What does it mean when I suggest that we let go? It means that we are attached to something (we all are, most of the time), and to let it go means to loosen that attachment.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s opening up of our grip, and letting the cherry blossoms blow in the wind as they will, out of our grasp.</p>\n<p>When you are angry at someone, you are unhappy with how they acted. You believe they should have acted some other way. The <em>should have acted</em> is what you&#8217;re holding onto. If you didn&#8217;t have the <em>should</em> so firmly attached in your mind, you wouldn&#8217;t be angry.</p>\n<p>So the answer is letting go of the should.</p>\n<p>The answer is to loosen the tight grip on the way you think things should be. And let the should blow away in the wind. Because in reality, we have no control over the <em>should</em> of reality. We can&#8217;t make other people act the way we&#8217;d like them to, because they&#8217;re not puppets. We can&#8217;t even make ourselves act the way we want, much of the time.</p>\n<p>We don&#8217;t control the <em>should</em>, and so letting go of our tight grasp of them, loosening up and learning to accept the uncontrollable nature of life, leads to many benefits. Let&#8217;s look at some of them below.</p>\n<h3>Productivity &amp; Letting Go</h3>\n<p>I&#8217;ve already given an example of how letting go of all that we want to do allows us to be more focused and effective, and accomplish more.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at a few more examples of how letting go improves productivity:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If we pick just three things on our to-do list that are important, and let go of the rest (for now), we can focus on the important things.</li>\n<li>If we let go of needing to stay current on everything, that will allow us to be less distracted by news and social media and messages and emails. We can then just focus on what&#8217;s important.</li>\n<li>If we let go of needing to say yes to every request, we will free up a lot of our time, and instead focus on what&#8217;s most important.</li>\n<li>If we let go of our urges to be entertained and distracted, we&#8217;ll free up time to focus on the important.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Attachments are getting in the way of our meaningful contributions to the world. Letting go is the answer.</p>\n<h3>Simplicity &amp; Letting Go</h3>\n<p>This past week, I started decluttering different areas of my life. I had to let go of a lot of hopes and dreams, because the reality is, I am not going to have time to do everything. That means I can let go of books, hobby equipment, and all kinds of other clutter that represented my aspirations.</p>\n<p>Holding on to how we think our lives <em>should</em> be &#8230; stands in the way of simplicity. This attachment clutters our lives, both with physical clutter and with days filled with complexity.</p>\n<p>Instead, we can let go of some of these aspirations, and focus on the ones that are truly meaningful.</p>\n<p>The clutter is flowing out my door, as I practice letting go.</p>\n<h3>Finances &amp; Letting Go</h3>\n<p>Recently Eva and I took a close look at our finances, and identified areas where we could trim down. It was a long-overdue look at our spending, after years of letting things creep higher and higher. I&#8217;m so happy we did it, but it meant letting go of things we have gotten used to. Ordering something as soon as we wanted it. Getting things for the house or the kids as soon as we decided we &#8220;needed&#8221; it.</p>\n<p>Now, we&#8217;re putting things on wishlists. And for my personal wishlist, I&#8217;m practicing changing the heading of that list from &#8220;wishlist&#8221; to &#8220;letting go of list&#8221;. I visualize all of these fantasies I had of buying the &#8220;perfect&#8221; anything, and letting them go into the breeze. It&#8217;s both frustrating and freeing.</p>\n<p>Letting go isn&#8217;t easy. But if we do, our finances can become so much healthier.</p>\n<h3>Happiness &amp; Letting Go</h3>\n<p>A lot of times, I&#8217;ll get frustrated with my kids. Or Eva. I&#8217;ll find my chest tightening up, and have a very strong urge to tell them what to do. To control them. To make them act as I think they <em>should</em> act. Other people can be so frustrating!</p>\n<p>But honestly, the problem isn&#8217;t with them. They&#8217;re all beautiful human beings, and my attachment to how they <em>should</em> act is getting in the way of me seeing that.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m missing out on their gorgeousness because I want them to be the way I think they should be. Instead of just seeing how awesome they already are!</p>\n<p>So I have to let go of my shoulds. I have to let go of the source of my frustration, which is my ideals.</p>\n<p>Instead, I can let go and open up to who they already are, and savor the deliciousness of that.</p>\n<h3>Weight Loss &amp; Letting Go</h3>\n<p>I have a bit of a belly. Yes, I know, I&#8217;m a horrible person. The world should shame me for having 20% bodyfat!</p>\n<p>But seriously, I decided I need to tighten up my diet a bit, because I&#8217;ve gotten into the habit of eating a bit too much every meal, and over the long term, that leads to a chunkier Leo. Still lovable, still wonderful, still sexy &#8230; but not good for my health.</p>\n<p>So I&#8217;ve set myself a plan: a green protein smoothie for breakfast, and a set meal for lunch and dinner (half a sweet potato, lentils, edamame, hummus, leafy greens, roasted cauliflower and broccoli, some sriracha sauce drizzled on top, some pickled daikon radish, yum!). No sweets or flour. Only eat between 11:30am and 5:30 pm (I haven&#8217;t implemented this last part yet).</p>\n<p>Anyway, it&#8217;s a simple plan, and it will absolutely work. Until my wife bakes vegan chocolate chip cookies, or the kids have vegan pizza. My two greatest nemeses.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard dealing with the urge to eat these delicious comfort foods. I have to see the urge, and let go.</p>\n<p>Loosen my grip on these tastes, and let them blow into the wind.</p>\n<p>Letting go, I open myself up to enjoy the yumminess of the food I already planned to have. Weight loss is that simple, if you practice letting go.</p>\n<h3>Getting Good at Letting Go</h3>\n<p>So it&#8217;s all easy and breezy, right? Not so fast. Letting go is the ultimate hack, but in truth, it&#8217;s hard as hell.</p>\n<p>We don&#8217;t <em>want</em> to let go. You might already have had that reaction to some of the things I&#8217;ve written: &#8220;But I like my (insert the thing you&#8217;re attached to here)! Why should I let go of it?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Because of your attachment.</p>\n<p>If you get in the habit of letting yourself hold on to all your attachments, you&#8217;re going to develop many difficulties in life. Maybe you already are dealing with those difficulties. Practicing letting go is a way to greater happiness, health and focus.</p>\n<p>So practice. In small doses, try noticing your attachment, and letting go of it, just for a few minutes.</p>\n<p>Try letting go of your distractions and need to be updated for one hour. See what that&#8217;s like.</p>\n<p>Try letting go of your electronics for two hours. What can you open up to instead?</p>\n<p>Try letting go of your usual comforts, for one day. What deliciousness can you experience instead?</p>\n<p>Try letting go of the things you want to buy, for one week (no buying anything but necessities like soap and toilet paper). What is that like?</p>\n<p>Practice letting go, just for a little bit. Every day.</p>\n<p>This daily practice is how you master it. And that&#8217;s mastering life.</p>\n<h3>Zen Productivity Workshop</h3>\n<p>Interested in working live with me, on Zen Productivity, simplicity or letting go?
