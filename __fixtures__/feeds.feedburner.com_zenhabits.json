These are people who have excelled at something in their lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They’re always looking to take themselves to the next level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they’re always wanting to make the most of their time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key to how to make the most of your time, if you’re a high performer, is finding high-impact ways to leverage your limited time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s take a look at some key ideas here.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Our Time is Limited</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I find it important to reflect on death, on a regular basis. Just the simple fact that we will die someday … and we don’t know when.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This helps us to remember that life is short and precious, and to resolve to make the most of this gift.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a high performer, you can make a big impact on the world, doing good and serving people in a meaningful way, with the limited time you have in this life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it’s important to do so by not frittering away time with busywork. We tend to go to the easy tasks, keeping busy by doing a bunch of little things. You could spend a year like this and not make much progress on anything meaningful, just staying afloat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s remind ourselves regularly that we have limited time each day and each week.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>We Have Too Many Things We Can Do</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Our time is limited, but our tasks are seemingly unlimited.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On any day, we have more things that we <em>could</em> do than we can actually get done. We’ll always finish the day with undone tasks. This is always true — every year, we have way more options than we can possibly take on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that in mind — that our time is limited, and we have more tasks/projects than we can possibly do — this brings home an important question:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How do we make the most of our limited time?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>More specifically: <strong>What’s the best investment of your time right now?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What high-impact task can best leverage your time right now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the only way to answer that is to answer these questions:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>What do you want to accomplish?</li><li>What impact do you want to have?</li><li>What would be meaningful to you?</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t know the answers to these questions, you can’t know what would be the best way to leverage your time. You can’t know which tasks to choose, because they’re all about the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Get Clear on What Matters</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What do you care most about accomplishing? And why?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do you want to do with this year? Quarter? Month? Week?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Write out the answers to those questions. Answering those questions is the thing you can do right now that would have the highest impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then answer:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do you want to do with this day?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Getting Good at Focus</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’ve gotten clear on what matters, the rest is execution. And you’re already pretty good at that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do you want to accomplish today? Get clear on that in the morning —&nbsp;or even better, the evening before. Make a list of 1-3 things — what key tasks should you focus on to leverage your time today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then in the morning, focus on those high-impact tasks. Use your time like a limited resource that it is: take it and make the most of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Focus on the things that matter. Clear everything else away, and don’t act on the urges to put off the important stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notice when you’re turning away from the high-impact tasks, and train yourself to turn towards it instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Batch the smaller stuff (like email and messages) and give that some time later in the day to focus, if that’s important to your work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Train yourself to focus, and train yourself to always know what you should focus on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then connect to why it’s meaningful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is how high performers can train to get the most out of their limited time, and make a meaningful impact on the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://fearless.zenhabits.net/coaching/\">Train with me: Coaching for High Performers</a> </h3>\n]]></content:encoded>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t</item>\r\n\t\t<item>\r\n\t\t<title>The Habit Dip</title>\r\n\t\t<link>https://zenhabits.net/dipped/</link>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[zenhabits]]></dc:creator>\r\n\t\t<pubDate>Sat, 19 Sep 2020 23:37:33 +0000</pubDate>\r\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Resiliency & Change]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncertainty & Discomfort]]></category>\r\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://zenhabits.net/?p=20694</guid>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[By Leo Babauta I was talking with a group of people in my Sea Change Program who had success with some difficult habits for a few months &#8230; and then hit a dip.

In fact, anytime you take on a project or goal, you will face this kind of dip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s the bad news —&nbsp;you&#8217;ll always hit a dip in motivation, focus, energy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&#8217;s good news too:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The dip is temporary, if you keep going through it; and</li><li>The dip is an incredible place of learning</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The last point is so important I need to repeat it: <strong>the dip is an incredible place of learning</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s the place where we learn and grow, and get better at facing difficulty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When things are going well, everything seems easy, and you just have to keep doing the same thing. There isn&#8217;t a lot of learning there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But when things are hard, you have to face the difficulty if you want to keep going, if you want to avoid going to your usual pattern of discouraging yourself or quitting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The dip is where the most learning can be found</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Learning of the Dip</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s so much to learn in the habit dip (and all <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1591841666/permissionmarket/\">other dips</a> of motivation &amp; focus):</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>How to face difficulty instead of avoiding it</li><li>How to encourage yourself when you feel discouraged</li><li>How to let go of the ideal you have that&#8217;s making you feel discouraged</li><li>How to deal with your difficult emotions of frustration, discouragement, fear</li><li>How to nourish yourself when you&#8217;re feeling depleted</li><li>How to give yourself compassion when you feel you&#8217;re doing something wrong</li><li>How to not run for your usual methods of control, avoidance, quitting when things are hard</li><li>How to practice letting go of your usual focus on your self-concern</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is just some of what&#8217;s there. There&#8217;s so much more. It&#8217;s incredibly rich, if you learn to open up to the dip.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Dip is Temporary, if You Keep Going</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Habit and motivation dips are always temporary. Everyone who has run a marathon or ultramathon knows what it&#8217;s like to want to quit, to get bored with training, to feel discouraged when things are hard. And so many of us who&#8217;ve faced that have finished the marathon!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve all given up when things are discouraging. We&#8217;ve all avoided even thinking about getting back on track when we&#8217;ve been thrown off the track. We&#8217;ve all messed up on projects and goals and habits. We&#8217;re human!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if we get back on track, if we encourage ourselves when things are dark, if we find compassion for ourselves when we&#8217;re not living up to our made-up ideals &#8230; there&#8217;s more available down the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything is temporary, even failure, even success, even getting off track. These are not the end points, they&#8217;re waypoints. Keep going.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How to Practice with It</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you&#8217;re ready to learn while you&#8217;re in the dip, then there are ways to practice and gain from this difficult area:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Come in with a learning mindset, one that is focused on growing instead of judging yourself.</li><li>Let go of your ideals, and bring curiosity instead. What can you find out about this?</li><li>Learn to face the difficult feelings in this area. Bring mindfulness to them, feel the bodily sensation of them. They&#8217;re not a big deal, just emotions.</li><li>Notice how you&#8217;re discouraging yourself. Don&#8217;t beat yourself up for discouraging yourself! But notice what you do.</li><li>Find ways to encourage yourself instead. Find ways to give yourself compassion. These are incredible skills to practice!</li><li>Find something new to learn, every time you bring your awareness to the dip. What else can you find out? And what else?</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If you go in with a mindset to embrace this difficult area, you&#8217;ll actually find your own ways to practice. But start with these.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can bring this mindset, so much is there for you. Be grateful when you find it.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t</item>\r\n\t\t<item>\r\n\t\t<title>How to Be More Present &amp; Alive in the Moment</title>\r\n\t\t<link>https://zenhabits.net/present-alive/</link>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[zenhabits]]></dc:creator>\r\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 11 Sep 2020 13:09:00 +0000</pubDate>\r\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Intimacy & Whole-Hearted Connection]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Mindfulness & Mastery]]></category>\r\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://zenhabits.net/?p=20692</guid>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[By Leo Babauta One of the people in my Fearless Mastery mastermind group is an amazing leader who is exceedingly good at getting things done and leading a team.

She wants more fun! And to be truly happy to be with the person she&#8217;s speaking with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I freaking love this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how do we become more present and alive in each moment? I have some ideas, based on the work I&#8217;ve been doing over the last 15 years on this.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Practice fully pouring yourself into every act</strong>. This is a Zen practice — being fully in every task you do, every act. If you&#8217;re sitting in meditation, be fully in your seat, not have your mind be somewhere else. If you&#8217;re brushing your teeth, just brush your teeth — and be completely immersed in that. This is a practice, of course, which means we&#8217;ll forget to do it most of the time, but it&#8217;s an incredibly rich practice. Fully express yourself in everything you do.</li><li><strong>See the divinity in the person in front of you or in this moment</strong>. When I say &#8220;divinity,&#8221; it might mean God if you believe in God &#8230; but if you don&#8217;t, it&#8217;s seeing the incredible gift of the world, of each person. Seeing the profound beauty in everything. Seeing the sacredness of the ordinary. When you&#8217;re talking with someone, can you fully appreciate their divinity? Can you feel wonder at the world around you, no matter where you are? This is an incredible practice that will help you feel more alive, each time you do it.</li><li><strong>Let yourself express your emotions physically</strong>. Working with my coach, I&#8217;ve discovered that I don&#8217;t let myself feel anger — the world trained me that it&#8217;s not OK to express or even feel anger. So every day, I practice not only feeling it, but physically expressing it in a safe way that doesn&#8217;t hurt people – for example, punching a pillow or yelling your head off in the woods or going crazy on a heavy punching bag. It&#8217;s not just anger, though –&nbsp;most of us barely let ourselves feel any emotions. We can express them physically — scream into a pillow, throw a tantrum by kicking and banging your fists on the ground, express pain by writhing in anguish or letting your heart be broken. When we express our emotions fully and physically in our bodies, we unleash our vitality.</li><li><strong>Open your damn heart!</strong> Most of us move through our days with our hearts closed. We do our tasks, go through the motions, but we aren&#8217;t connected to our hearts. (Some people, of course, are able to live in their hearts much of the time —&nbsp;let them be our role models!) What would it be like to be open-hearted today, feel loving toward every person you see, loving and tender toward the world around you? Try it and see!</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see, these are not things that you&#8217;ll be able to get perfect, immediately or even ever. They are things to practice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I can tell you, in my experience, this kind of practice of being fully immersed in each activity, with your heart open, your emotions fully expressed, seeing the divinity in everything and everyone around you — this will help us be fully alive in each moment.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t</item>\r\n\t\t<item>\r\n\t\t<title>The Subtle Power of Changing Your Identity</title>\r\n\t\t<link>https://zenhabits.net/identity/</link>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[zenhabits]]></dc:creator>\r\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 04 Sep 2020 08:09:00 +0000</pubDate>\r\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Resiliency & Change]]></category>\r\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://zenhabits.net/?p=20691</guid>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[By Leo Babauta One of the most powerful switches I ever made when changing my entire life was switching up my identity.

It literally took meat off the menu for me, so that I didn&#8217;t even consider eating it.</li><li>I thought of myself as a marathoner. Later, as just someone who exercises regularly to stay fit and healthy. It meant that there was no question I was going to exercise, even if I fell out of it for a bit because of disruptions.</li><li>I became a meditator (and later Zen student). That means even if I stop meditating for a little bit, I&#8217;ll always come back to it.</li><li>I became a writer. Sure, before this change, I did write, but not daily (join my <a href=\"http://seachange.zenhabits.net/\">Create Daily Challenge in Sea Change</a> if you want to change this one!).</li><li>I became a minimalist. Actually, before I decided to call myself that, there wasn&#8217;t really anyone else who called themselves &#8220;minimalists&#8221;. The purposeful change in identity allowed me to free myself of clutter and enjoy a life of less.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There are dozens of other examples: as a father, unschooling parent, early riser, reader, teacher, speaker, entrepreneur, someone who takes meticulous care of his finances &#8230; every time I&#8217;ve made a major (or minor) life change that stuck, I changed my identity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s more powerful than most people realize, and it&#8217;s doable.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Subtle Benefits of Changing Your Identity</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While it takes a little work, if you can shift how you see yourself &#8230; you&#8217;ll likely notice some of these benefits that aren&#8217;t obvious to most people:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>You&#8217;ll stop doing (some of) the behaviors that you used to do. Stop smoking, stop eating meat, stop playing video games, whatever someone with your identity wouldn&#8217;t do.</li><li>You&#8217;ll make the behaviors you want become a given. If you&#8217;re a writer, you write every day. No questions asked. If you&#8217;re an entrepreneur, you &#8230; entreprendre every day? You know what I mean.</li><li>Things that you have to debate yourself about &#8230; become not a question. This saves you a lot of mental energy. It becomes much less of a daily struggle.</li><li>You can change some long-standing beliefs about yourself. That you can&#8217;t do this, that you&#8217;re no good at this, that you aren&#8217;t someone who does this. If they&#8217;re not serving you, toss em!</li><li>You begin to get a mindset that you can change anything. That you&#8217;re not stuck in old ways, but someone who can grow and become new possibility.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There are more benefits, but I&#8217;m going to let you discover them on your own. By now, it&#8217;s probably best to get to the How.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How to Change Your Identity</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, it&#8217;s not as easy as flipping a switch and bam presto! You&#8217;re a new person. However, it&#8217;s eminently doable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can be done a million different ways, but here are some points I&#8217;ve found important:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Do it consciously</strong>. We can change our identity without doing it intentionally &#8230; but I&#8217;ve found that it works much better if you do it intentionally. Doing it accidentally is like blindly stumbling upon something amazing — I wouldn&#8217;t count on it, but if you wander around long enough, it&#8217;ll probably happen. Instead, make it an intention to consciously shift your identity in this area.</li><li><strong>Think about who you want to be</strong>. Do you want to be a person who writes every morning? A person who only eats plant-based foods? Someone who buys very little? Write it down: &#8220;I am a morning meditator.&#8221;</li><li><strong>Intentionally start doing the actions</strong>. Set up visual reminders, phone reminders, whatever you need to do &#8230; but start doing the things that you would do if you&#8217;re this new version of yourself. If you&#8217;re a runner, go run.</li><li><strong>BE the new version of you</strong>. Doing the actions is one thing, but you might be doing it while thinking that this is <em>so not you</em>. Instead, do the actions as if you were already that person. See yourself as the runner, the early riser, the vegan. Feel it in your being. Stand as this person.</li><li><strong>Reinforce it by appreciating yourself</strong>. Each day, have a minute where you look back and see what you did. And appreciate this about yourself. See that you&#8217;re already shifting. &#8220;Yeah, this is happening, good job me!&#8221; We tend to focus on the bumps in the road rather than the progress we&#8217;re making.</li><li><strong>When you falter, think about what this new version of you would do</strong>. Notice I said &#8220;when you falter,&#8221; not &#8220;IF.&#8221; Even a Zen teacher misses a day of meditation sometimes. That&#8217;s a part of life. We don&#8217;t always do things &#8220;perfectly&#8221; &#8230; but a Zen teacher wouldn&#8217;t miss a day of meditation and then just give up. She&#8217;d just sit the next day. A runner will get back into it even after a week of disruption (maybe due to visitors, illness, travel, injury, etc.). Don&#8217;t think of the disruption as proof that you&#8217;re not a runner, but instead approach the disruption as if you are a runner.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, there are many other things you can do. As your new identity, you&#8217;ll think of them! The How actually works itself out once you start to Be the new identity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>A Caveat: Don&#8217;t Fix Your Identity &amp; Become Rigid</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that creating a new identity for yourself — seeing yourself in a new way — can also. have some pitfalls. A big one is that you might create a fixed, rigid view of yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you create a new identity of yourself that you&#8217;re an early riser, that could come with the rigidity that you&#8217;ll never stay up late or sleep in a little. And if your family has a gathering that&#8217;s later in the evening, you might just pass — not because it will impact anything important, but because of a rigid view of yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are lots of other possible examples: if I always work hard, then I can&#8217;t take a rest; if I am an expert in my field, then I can&#8217;t ever admit I&#8217;m wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don&#8217;t want our view of ourselves to limit us always. Some limits are helpful, if they&#8217;re chosen consciously (i.e. a limit of no meat means I don&#8217;t harm animals). Other limits can be unhelpful, if they don&#8217;t let us do what would be beneficial in a situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So while shifting identity can be helpful, I encourage you to not be too rigid. Think of your identity as fluid, something you can shift as needed, consciously.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Next Steps</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I encourage you to pick one area at a time. Don&#8217;t try to shift everything about yourself. Choose one, and apply the steps above.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am compassionate about myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I write every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am a loving parent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What would you like to try on?</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t</item>\r\n\t\t<item>\r\n\t\t<title>Clear Things Out</title>\r\n\t\t<link>https://zenhabits.net/tend/</link>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[zenhabits]]></dc:creator>\r\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 13:05:00 +0000</pubDate>\r\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Simplicity & Slowness]]></category>\r\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://zenhabits.net/?p=20689</guid>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[By Leo Babauta I&#8217;ve recently reminded myself of the value of dedicating some time to just clearing things out.

Emails pile up, clutter piles up, read later list piles up, small admin tasks build up like cruft.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the nature of things: they accumulate if we don&#8217;t tend to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, we must tend to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I&#8217;ve found valuable is leaving some blocks of time for clearing things out:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Some space at the end of each day to clear out your email inbox or unread messages in Slack</li><li>A day every week where I read through my read-later list (I use Instapaper) and empty it out</li><li>A day to get to all the small admin tasks that pile up, or a couple of half days</li><li>A time on the weekend for taking care of small chores and repairs that I didn&#8217;t have time to get to during the week</li><li>A Sunday weekly review where I make sure all the piles are cleared, my todo and project lists are updated, and everything is in order</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These don&#8217;t have to take long — an hour, sometimes less. Some things take a few hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem is that we pack our days with tasks, meetings, calls, and other things so much that we don&#8217;t leave spaciousness for tending to our lives. And when we do have some space, we tend to fill it with our favorite distractions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s all fine, but it&#8217;s also incredibly helpful to leave some space to tending to our little gardens. Clear out the weeds, take care of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mental health that results from tending to our lives, clearing out piles, and cleaning up messes is incredibly replenishing.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t</item>\r\n\t\t<item>\r\n\t\t<title>Staying Connected to Meaning in Your Work</title>\r\n\t\t<link>https://zenhabits.net/meaningful/</link>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[zenhabits]]></dc:creator>\r\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 21 Aug 2020 13:13:00 +0000</pubDate>\r\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Intimacy & Whole-Hearted Connection]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Purpose-Filled Work & Life]]></category>\r\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://zenhabits.net/?p=20686</guid>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[By Leo Babauta For anyone trying to do meaningful work, feeling connected to that meaning can be a big challenge.

To why you care about doing this in the first place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We get stuck in the drudgery of doing endless meaningless tasks, stuck in task mode, rather than feeling that the tasks are meaningful ways to spend our day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how do we deal with this challenge? Not surprisingly, the answer is practice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s take a look.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Have a Deeper Why</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you haven’t done this step yet, don’t skip it. We need to find a deeper reason to do our work, other than, “To get paid,” or “Because it’s on my list or in my inbox,” or “Because other people are waiting for me to do it.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we don’t have a deeper reason, work becomes meaningless drudgery. We can put up with it for years, but it won’t feel like a meaningful way to spend our lives. It won’t feel <em>inspired</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So why do you care about doing what you do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes this meaningful to you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are lots of possible answers … here are a few:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Because you’re helping people you care about</li><li>To make a change in the world that feels powerful</li><li>To help people who are struggling or in pain</li><li>To preserve something you care about</li><li>To protect or serve your loved ones</li><li>It’s an act of love for yourself or others</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In my experience, the most meaningful reasons to do anything are to serve others, out of love. But sometimes, we have to start by loving ourselves — that’s incredibly meaningful as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So get clear on your Why. <em>Feel connected to it</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Set Rituals to Connect with Meaning</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It turns out, just knowing why something is meaningful isn’t enough —&nbsp;we tend to forget it as soon as we get into Doing mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so having points during your day when you connect to your meaning is a good idea. Create some rituals that will remind you to practice feeling connected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some simple examples:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A short 2-5 minute meditation in the morning or evening, where you visualize the people you care about, and practice connecting to their hearts</li><li>A devotional practice on your yoga mat, or in front of an altar, where you think about the struggles of the people you’re helping, and devote your work to them</li><li>A photo, Buddha statue, vase of flowers, candle — some object that will remind you to pause and practice feeling connected to your Why</li><li>A short moment of pause, where you set intentions before you start writing or answering messages (for example) — intentions of serving people you care about</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>What rituals would you like to create to connect to your meaning?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Practice Connecting to Meaning</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rituals are structure in our lives to help us remember to feel connected to meaning … but they won’t really do anything if we just go through the motions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have to practice really <em>feeling</em> the meaning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how do we do that? For me, it’s about feeling it in my heart. I practice feeling the love and devotion for the people I care about (all of you!), picturing any difficulties, struggle, pain or fear that you might have, and wishing you all happiness. Basically, a version of lovingkindness meditation, aimed specifically at the people I’m trying to serve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I practice standing as Love, in my being. I practice feeling compassion in my heart. I practice feeling devotion to those I care deeply about, in my core. And then I see what flows from that — writing an article like this, recording a video, sending an email or message.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I practice trying to reconnect to that feeling as I’m writing or doing the task. I’ll forget, and lose connection, over and over again. That’s OK —&nbsp;it’s not about being perfect. It’s about coming back to meaning, over and over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because it makes every single thing I do so much more meaningful. Because it infuses my life with meaning. This is an inspired life! I wish you nothing less.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t</item>\r\n\t\t<item>\r\n\t\t<title>Staying Focused with a Simple Method</title>\r\n\t\t<link>https://zenhabits.net/simple-focus/</link>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[zenhabits]]></dc:creator>\r\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 17 Aug 2020 13:14:00 +0000</pubDate>\r\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Mindfulness & Mastery]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Purpose-Filled Work & Life]]></category>\r\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://zenhabits.net/?p=20685</guid>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[&#8220;There is surely nothing other than the single purpose of the present moment.

Live being true to the single purpose of the moment.&#8221;</p><cite>Hagakure</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h4>By <a href=\"http://leobabauta.com\">Leo Babauta</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re in a job where you could be doing a thousand things, staying focused for most of the day can become a big problem. We want to do too much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today I’d like to talk about this hard problem faced by anyone doing meaningful work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t tackle this challenge, you’ll be left feeling scattered and unfocused, overwhelmed and disconnected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can take it on … you can create an experience of getting meaningful things done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How does that sound? Let’s dive in.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Staying Focused on Meaningful Tasks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t think I need to go too much into the problem of feeling scattered and unfocused during the day — most of us are pretty damn familiar with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how do we tackle it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The method is fairly simple, though of course it’s so easy to be led astray from it (I lose this thread all the time). I’ve been advocating this for almost 14 years now:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Make a short list</strong>. I recommend 3-5 important, meaningful tasks. And then a few more smaller tasks you’ll take on later in the day when you don’t have as much focus power. These are the tasks you’ll take on today (ideally make the list the evening before).</li><li><strong>Order the list, and pick the top one</strong>. If you spend time the evening before, or just a few minutes first thing in the morning, prioritizing your short list … you won’t have to think about it when the time comes to execute. This is really important. Don’t let yourself negotiate — pick the top thing on your list and don’t question it at execution time.</li><li><strong>Execute your ass off on this one thing</strong>. Focus on this and nothing else. Close off distractions. Don’t worry about everything else that needs to be done. This is the only thing in the universe. If you get interrupted, take care of the interruption (or put it on your list for later), and then get back to focusing. Pour yourself into it, with as much meaning as you can (more on this below).</li><li><strong>Repeat</strong>. When you’re done with the task or can’t work on it because you’re waiting on something, pick the next one on the list. When you don’t have focus power anymore (late afternoon for me), take care of the smaller, easy tasks that need to get done.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>I keep one long list of tasks that I need (or would like) to do sometime (my backlog), and pick from that each day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s important to keep the list short — you don’t want to have everything you could possibly do on the short list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s talk about the common problems you’ll face — especially the biggest problem of all.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Common Problems (Including the Big One)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some key problems to know about and take on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you finish your short list tasks early, you could get more from your long list … or take the rest of the day off!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t get them all done (very common), just put them back on the long list or carry them forward to tomorrow’s short list. You only need two text documents (or Google docs) to do this method.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This method solves the very very common problem of trying to do too much — it asks you to only do a few things, and really only one thing at a time. You always know what that one thing is, so there’s no overwhelming number of choices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The biggest problem, if you’re doing this method, is feeling like you don’t want to do a task</strong>, and avoiding by going to easy tasks or distractions. This is so common that there are a thousand books written about it. Don’t beat yourself up about it, it’s a human trait — just notice. It’s easy to notice with this method, because you always know what you should be focused on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you notice yourself avoiding something hard or uncertain … <strong>the method is to turn towards it</strong>. Turn towards what you’re avoiding. Open to the discomfort, embrace it as training and growth. Bring curiosity. Do it even when you don’t feel like it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the training. The simple method makes it easier. Take it on, and see what happens.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t</item>\r\n\t\t<item>\r\n\t\t<title>Work Less</title>\r\n\t\t<link>https://zenhabits.net/work-less/</link>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[zenhabits]]></dc:creator>\r\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 06 Aug 2020 13:13:00 +0000</pubDate>\r\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Purpose-Filled Work & Life]]></category>\r\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://zenhabits.net/?p=20684</guid>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[By Leo Babauta When it comes to work, I’ve found that most of us fall in one of two camps: We work way too hard, constantly churning, never feeling like we got enough done; or We put off work, going to distractions, feeling guilty about how little we’re getting done.

And it drains us. It leaves us feeling depleted, not alive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s no simple solution to this, of course, but I’d like to propose something here, to both camps:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Work less</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do fewer things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be more fully in those fewer things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recognize your victories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rest more. Play more. Connect more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s look at this from the perspective of each camp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And please note: I know that not everyone falls into these camps, and not everyone can change the number of hours they work. Take from this post what might be useful to you, toss out the rest.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Work Too Hard Camp</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the camp I’ve been in lately — we try to get everything done. When there are things left undone (there always are), we feel like we haven’t done enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We never feel like we’ve done enough. Even when, by all external standards, we’re kicking ass.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So working less seems like an impossible thing … but if you recognize that we’re working too much, then it’s actually an obvious fix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working less would mean reducing the number of things we do — which would mean focusing on higher priority tasks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you could only work 1 hour today, what would you spend that hour doing? What would you do with the rest of the things on your list?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we ask ourselves these questions, it might become clear that there are some key items we could spend more of our attention on, and many other tasks we could let go of somehow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, after we’ve reduced the number of things, we can practice being more fully in those things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then call it a day — a victorious day, where we got the important things done.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now ask yourself this question: if you had 2 hours of free time where you couldn’t work … what would you do with those hours?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of us spend free time doing more work. Or going to favorite distractions. But what if we used that time to be fully connected to the people we care about? Or to take care of ourselves, to read, to play, to do nothing?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Procrastinate Too Much Camp</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I was in this group for years. In this camp, we don’t feel that the “work less” philosophy should apply to us, because we already feel we’re not working enough. We feel guilty for all the time we waste.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, let’s start by tossing out that guilt. It’s toxic! We heap all kinds of expectations on ourselves, and then beat ourselves up when we fail to meet those made-up expectations. Let’s throw all that out and start fresh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a fresh slate … what would you do with your day? What would feel like an absolute victory?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this camp, “work less” means have fewer hours, but more focused ones. Spend less of it in avoidance and frittering away the time, cut back the number of hours you work, and be fully in those remaining hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you were only to work 2 hours today … what would you do with those hours? What tasks would be most important to accomplish? What would make this day feel victorious?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’ve identified those tasks, set aside the time, block out the distractions, and pour yourself into them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can help to do them in 15-20-minute chunks, with headphones and music, or for longer sessions to do it on a call with someone else who is trying to focus on their meaningful work as well. Help each other focus, celebrate each other’s victories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you could work fewer but more focused hours, you’d free up time for <a href=\"https://zenhabits.net/resting/\">true rest</a>. For play, connection, self-care. And perhaps, more than doing the tasks themselves, this would be the true victory.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t</item>\r\n\t\t<item>\r\n\t\t<title>Showing Up Even When You’re Not Feeling It</title>\r\n\t\t<link>https://zenhabits.net/feeling-it/</link>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[zenhabits]]></dc:creator>\r\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 31 Jul 2020 21:13:17 +0000</pubDate>\r\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Mindfulness & Mastery]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Purpose-Filled Work & Life]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncertainty & Discomfort]]></category>\r\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://zenhabits.net/?p=20681</guid>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[By Leo Babauta Some days, you’re just not feeling it.

It’s not that you’re exhausted, it’s that you’re not in the mood to do the important task that’s in front of you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You want to just go to distractions all day long, do anything but this thing you’re resisting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I get it. I have these days too. And sometimes, the answer is just rest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other times, it’s useful to find a way to do the work anyway, because if we only do our important work when we feel like it, we might not ever get it done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s useful to learn to do it even when we’re not feeling it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how do we do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Mistaken Belief</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of us have an expectation that we should feel in the mood to do something. We should be excited, rested, focused. And when we do it, it should be easy, comfortable, fun, pleasurable. Something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That results, predictably, in running from the things that feel hard, overwhelming, uncomfortable. It means that when we’re not feeling it, we are going to run to distractions and comforts. Nothing wrong with this, but it usually creates a life we’re not happy with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we do the thing we don’t want to do, it is often uncomfortable or difficult. We feel like we’re forcing ourselves to do something we really don’t want to do, which can feel coercive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No wonder we avoid it! Who wants to feel coerced?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that comes from our belief that we should only do things when we’re feeling in the mood, and that things should be easy, comfortable and fun. That means we can never do anything hard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if we could open to doing hard things, and maybe even loving them?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Doing Hard Things When I’m Not Feeling It</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So for me, I try to notice when I have an expectation that I be in the mood, or that the thing be easy, fun, or comfortable. Just noticing the expectation allows me to choose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once I’m in a place where I can choose … I can decide that actually, it’s not just “fine” that I do things that are uncomfortable when I’m not in the mood … in fact, it’s an experience I <em>choose to practice with</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I choose to open myself to this work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I choose to move into something challenging, difficult, uncertain, uncomfortable. Just like I choose to do a workout or go for a run, even when they’re hard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And further … I can actually love the experience. Sure, it might not seem like it … but can you love a child when they’re being difficult? You might not love the way they’re being, but you can love them. You can love any of your friends or family when they’re difficult — the way their being might not be your favorite, but you love them anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can love writing this article, even if I’m not quite in the mood for it. I can change my experience, by being grateful that I get to write it. That I’m even alive right now! That I have so much love in my life that people want to read this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I can see that some tasks are a brick in the larger building that I’m putting together. One brick at a time, I’m creating a meaningful future. I can wait to be happy when the building is done … or I can love every single freaking brick. I choose to love the brick, and the laying of that brick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of our most meaningful experiences are difficult. Running a marathon, giving birth to a child, creating anything important or meaningful. These are not easy experiences, and yet, they’re <em>more meaningful because they’re not easy</em>. Would we rob ourselves of these meaningful experiences by shying away from their difficulty?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the training is to 1) notice the expectation that has me shying away from the work, and 2) open myself up to the meaningful experience of that work, despite its difficulty, despite my not feeling it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s something beautiful that happens when you do something even when you’re not feeling it.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t</item>\r\n\t\t<item>\r\n\t\t<title>The Simplicity of Discipline: Thriving Without the Baggage of Expectations</title>\r\n\t\t<link>https://zenhabits.net/simple-discipline/</link>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[zenhabits]]></dc:creator>\r\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 24 Jul 2020 13:07:00 +0000</pubDate>\r\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Productivity & Organization]]></category>\r\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Purpose-Filled Work & Life]]></category>\r\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://zenhabits.net/?p=20679</guid>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[By Leo Babauta The clients I work with almost all put incredible expectations on themselves — they have higher standards than almost anybody I know.

It’s why they work with me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can be hard to see, but the expectations they’ve set for themselves often stand in the way of what they want the most.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s hard to see, because they became successful because of those expectations. It’s what got them this far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But after a certain point, the expectations become the anchor, not the engine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The breakthrough to the next level for many of us who perform at high levels —&nbsp;and actually for people of all kinds — is to let go of all expectations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tony Robbins is famous for saying, “Turn your expectations … into appreciation.” It’s a beautiful saying, and helps us to start to see where expectations are getting in the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s take a look.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Expectations Often Only Seem to Help</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I know lots of people who improved their lives because they had an expectation that they should be better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I should be in better shape. I should have a better job. I should be more productive. I should be more discipined. I should be more mindful. I should eat healthier.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know these expectations well — that was me at the start of my journey. It’s how almost all of us start out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We take these expectations and turn them into action. “OK, it’s finally time to get off my butt and do something about this problem!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that’s when change starts to happen — when we’ve motivated ourselves to start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So expectations can seem like they’re doing a lot of work, because they’re the things that got us to start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then they start getting in the way:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>I expected to be great at this habit after a few days, but a week into it and I still suck at it</li><li>I expected to be perfect at this habit but I’m still struggling</li><li>I expected to keep my streak going past 2 weeks but then I missed a day</li><li>I expected to really enjoy yoga or meditation but it’s way harder than I thought</li><li>This doesn’t meet my expectations, so it sucks (can’t appreciate it)</li><li>I’m so focused on how I want things to turn out (expectations) that I miss the beauty of what’s happening in this moment</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The expectations actually hold us back from the simplicity of discipline.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Simplicity of Discipline</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The things we want to be disciplined at are actually fairly simple in a lot of ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We want to be consistent with the journaling habit, or meditation, or exercise? Just start, as simply as possible. Do that again the next day. If you miss a day, no problem — just start again. Over and over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of the problems of habits start to go away when we drop expectations. We can start to appreciate doing the habit, in this moment, instead of being so concerned with how it will turn out in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s very simple, when we drop the expectations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A daily writing habit becomes as simple as picking up the writing tool and doing it, without any expectation that it be any good or that people love it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A daily exercise habit becomes as simple as putting your shoes on, going outside, and going for a walk or a run or a hike or a bodyweight workout. You don’t need fancy equipment, the perfect program, or a membership to anything. You just start moving, as simply as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, we have all kinds of hangups when it comes to exercise, or writing, or eating. These come from years of beating ourselves up (or getting judged by others, and internalizing those judgments). We can stop beating ourselves up the moment we drop expectations. Then, without the layers of self-judgment, we can simply get moving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every time we “fail” at a habit, we get discouraged. Because of expectations. What if we dropped any expectation that we be perfect at it, and just return to doing the habit at the earliest opportunity? Over and over again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It all becomes exceedingly simple, once we can drop expectations. And if we become fully present, it can even be joyful! The joy of being in the moment, doing something meaningful.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Dropping the Expectations</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So simple right? Now we just have to figure out how to drop those pesky expectations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s the thing: it turns out the human mind is a powerful expectations generator. Like all the time, it’s creating expectations. Just willy nilly, without any real grounding in reality. Out of thin air.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So do we just turn off the expectations machine? Good luck. I’ve never seen anyone do that. In fact, the hope that we can just turn off the expectations is in itself an expectation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The practice is to just notice the expectations. Bring a gentle awareness to them. Just say, “Aha! I see you, Expectation. I know you’re the reason I’m feeling discouraged, overwhelmed, behind, frustrated, inadequate.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it’s true, isn’t it? We feel inadequate because we have some expectation that we be more than this. We feel behind because of some made up expectations of what we should have done already. We feel discouraged because we haven’t met some expectation. We feel overwhelmed because we have an expectation that we should be able to handle all of this easily and at once. We feel frustrated because someone (us, or someone else) has failed to meet an expectation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of these feelings are clear-cut signs that we have an expectation. And we can simply bring awareness to the expectation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then we’re in a place of choice. Do I want to hold myself and everything else to this made-up ideal? Or can I let go of that and simply see things as they are? Simply do the next step.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seeing things as they are, without expectations, is seeing the bare experience, the actual physical reality of things, without all of the ideals and fantasies and frustrations we layer on top of reality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means that when we miss a day, we don’t have to get caught up in thoughts about how that sucks — we just look at the moment we’re in, and sit down on the meditation cushion. Break out the writing pad. Do the next thing, with clear eyes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in this place of choice, we can decide whether we want to stay in this fantasy world of expectations … or drop out of it into the world as it is. Which is wide open. Ready for us to go do the next thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s the choice we can make, every time, if we are aware of our expectations in the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Two Simple Discipline Practices</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s talk briefly about two practices: the discipline of doing work, and the discipline of sticking consistently to a habit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Discipline of Doing Work</strong>: So let’s say you have a task list, with 5 important tasks, and 10 smaller ones (including respond to Tanya’s email, buy a replacement faucet for the kitchen sink, etc.).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What would stand in the way of doing all of that? Not being clear on what to do first (or the expectation that you pick the “right” task), feeling resistance to doing it (expectation that work be comfortable), worried about how it will turn out (expectation that people think you’re awesome), stressed about all the things you have to do today (expectation that you have a calm, orderly, simple day), wanting to run to your favorite distractions (expectation that things be easy).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So noticing these difficulties caused by expectations … you can decide if you want to be in this place of expectations, or if you’d like to drop them and just be in the moment as it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then you do the simple discipline of work:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Pick one task. Whatever feels important right now. Let go of expectations that it be the right task.</li><li>Put everything else aside — other tasks, distractions. Let go of the expectation that you do everything right now, and that what you do should be easy and comfortable.</li><li>Do the task. Be in the moment with it. Let go of expectations of comfort, or expectations that you succeed at this and that others not judge you. Just do. Find the joy of doing.</li><li>Stay with it as long as you can. If you get interrupted, simply come back.</li><li>When you’re done, or it’s time to move on, pick something else. Let go of expectations that you have everything done right away, and just pick one thing to do next.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>And repeat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important to make a distinction — between letting go of the expectation that you not be tired, and overworking yourself. We are not advocating overworking yourself to burnout. But that doesn&#8217;t mean we should never do anything when we&#8217;re not feeling it. We have to let go of the expectation that we not be tired when we work &#8230; and also the expectation that we never stop working. Rest when you need it, but don&#8217;t let yourself off the hook just because you don&#8217;t feel like it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Discipline of Consistent Habits</strong>: Let’s say you want to get more consistent with habits. You pick one — journaling, for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What would get in the way of consistency with this habit? Not making space for it in your day (expecting things to come easy without fully committing to it), not enjoying the habit (expecting things to be comfortable and fun), not doing as well as you hoped and getting discouraged (expectations that you’ll be great at it), missing some days and getting discouraged (expectation that you be perfectly consistent), resisting doing it when you have other things to do (expectation that you don’t have to sacrifice something you want to do this habit).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So noticing these difficulties caused by expectations … you can decide if you want to be in this place of expectations, or if you’d like to drop them and just be in the moment as it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then you do the simple discipline of this habit:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Carve out space. Commit yourself to doing this habit in that space.</li><li>Do the habit. Notice if you’re feeling resistance, and just do it.</li><li>You might even appreciate the habit as you do it, if you let go of how you think it should be. You might find the joy of doing it as well.</li><li>Do it the next day, and the next day.</li><li>If you miss a day, simply start again, letting go of expectations about yourself.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re struggling with feeling tired and not wanting to do something, this is because of an expectation that you not be tired, and not have to do things when you don’t feel like it. Letting go of that, you can simply do the task or habit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll notice that none of this says that doing the task or habit will be easy, comfortable, or without fear or tiredness or uncertainty. That would be an expectation. In fact, there’s a good chance that these will be present for you in the moment, as you do the task or habit. That’s OK —&nbsp;we’re not going to expect it to be any different than it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So then, letting go of that, we simply turn to what’s in the moment, and get on with it.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t</item>\r\n\t</channel>\r\n</rss>\r\n",
